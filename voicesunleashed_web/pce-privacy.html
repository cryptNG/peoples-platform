        <h2>People's Choice Extender - A CryptNG Chrome Extension</h2>

        <p>
            People's Choice Extender, a pioneering component of the People's Platform, is dedicated to offering a censorship-free environment for creating, promoting, and monetizing YouTube content, with the aid of community engagement and blockchain technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            This extension empowers users to vote on YouTube videos directly on the blockchain, operational as of December 26, 2023, on the Gnosis chain and several test networks. It also facilitates a unique system where community contributions to a smart contract help manage and distribute funds to content creators based on the upvotes and downvotes they receive.
        </p>

        <h3>Local Cache Storage and Data Visibility</h3>
        <p>
            To enhance user experience, the People's Choice Extender employs local cache storage. This storage tracks your voting interactions with YouTube videos. Data is stored in a key:value pair format, where the key is the URL of the video and the value is a boolean indicating your vote ("true" for an upvote, "false" for a downvote).
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to understand that clearing your cache, uninstalling the extension, switching to a new Chrome profile, or changing devices will result in the deletion of this locally stored data. However, this does not mean your votes are lost. They are securely stored on the blockchain and continue to contribute to the fund calculations for creators. This local storage is a convenience feature to prevent you from unintentionally voting multiple times on the same video, though voluntary multiple votes are permitted.
        </p>

        <h3>Purpose of Data Storage</h3>
        <p>
            The primary purpose of this data storage is to provide a convenient and seamless user experience. By tracking your voting history on YouTube videos, the extension prevents accidental repeat voting and enhances the usability of the interface.
        </p>

        <h3>Commitment to Data Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            At CryptNG, we are firmly committed to your privacy. The data collected by the People's Choice Extender is never shared externally nor used for analytical purposes. It is exclusively utilized to improve your user experience, aligning with our dedication to uphold the highest standards of data privacy and protection.
